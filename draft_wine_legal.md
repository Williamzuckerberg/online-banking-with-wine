Beware of Legal Requirements
You must state that you will follow these minimal legal requirements during the SoC (and have done so in the past):
You are not allowed to read or reuse Windows source code (leaked source / Windows Research Kernel**/ ...)
(** we are following the SFLC's advice)
You are not allowed to reverse engineer Windows files by disassembling or decompiling them
You are not allowed to analyze Windows files with the trace functions of Wine
People who work or have worked for Microsoft should probably not participate
